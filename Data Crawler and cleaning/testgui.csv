10,Benjammn,"Ok, so let's say your hypothesis is true and it is inflated.  What percentage of the death count would you think is A) accurate and B) not a national tragedy?  50% (350,000 people)?  25% (175,000 people)?  Do you understand how callous this viewpoint is to the suffering caused by COVID?

Also, read up on excess deaths too.  Between March 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021, the US experienced over 520,000 excess deaths and over 370,000 deaths due to COVID.  So there were 150,000 more deaths than expected last year that weren't recorded as being caused by COVID.  How many of those cases do you think were actually COVID deaths that didn't get tested or reported?

I'm not saying the data is perfect, but simply stating that the count is drastically lower is completely wrong and that your anecdotal proof falls flat in the face of actual statistics, which state that the COVID death count could be even larger than the reported amount.",2021-10-15,3

30,allankcrain,"Reminder that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine doesn't use the mRNA technique, just the same time-tested method of vaccine creation that we've been using for decades. Anyone who's hesitant about mRNA vaccines specifically can get that one instead. It's only one shot, and it's still extremely effective.

And again, it doesn't matter if you personally aren't at high risk for covid (plus you ARE at risk, just LOWER risk). You likely interact with people who are. You need to get vaccinated to protect THEM, not to protect yourself. If you're young and strong and healthy, you could catch covid and not even realize you're sick, which means you can pass covid along just by breathing in the wrong place and cause someone else to die. I don't understand why people on the anti-vax side of this argument don't seem to get this. The reason you get vaccinated is to protect those around you; the fact that it also protects you is just a nice side effect. Just like how it's illegal to drive drunk--it's perfectly legal for you to drink yourself to death or get drunk and do something stupid and reckless that only risks your own life, but we make drunk driving illegal to protect everyone around you. 

And anticipating your immediate response of ""If other people are worried, THEY can get the vaccine"": 

1. No vaccines are 100% effective, so while breakthrough cases are relatively low, they're not zero.
2. If you're the sort of person making these arguments, you probably associate with with a bunch of people who similarly distrust the vaccine and are extremely high-risk. 
3. The virus mutates when it spreads. If it spends enough time bouncing around through unvaccinated healthy people, eventually it might mutate into something that the vaccines are much less effective against or which is much more likely to kill young and healthy people.
4. If you do fall into the fairly large group of people who are younger but still get deathly ill with covid, you're taking up a hospital bed and hospital resources.",2021-10-15,1

I remember being quite homesick at the time (I had come back to the uk for a visit a few months beforehand) and was definitely thinking about whether I was making the right decision. 

The day after that vote I realized that my “home” wasn’t all that “homely” anymore and was heading in a different direction to where I wanted to go. 

There’s still opportunities there, there’s just more hoops to jump through if you’re “unskilled, unqualified” etc. 

If you’re a young person reading this and you just want to Brexit from Britain, get certificates (degrees, trades whatever) and get out to the countries you want to get to. It’s far easier to apply for extended visas, residency and citizenship when you’re in the actual country you want to live in than being elsewhere.
