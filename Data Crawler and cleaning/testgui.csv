2,Dontevenreaddit,"Alright i see your point. But it would make more sense to give me the choice instead of forcing an experimental serum upon me. I would sign for the fact i won't use the hospital if im sick from covid. 

Funny thing, i already had it, nothing happened no symptoms whatsoever. Yet they spend tons of money to force the injection upon me. Why ? Now i know you prob don't like the term experimental serum , but that's exactly what it is. 

Per definition, its not allowed to call it a vaccin, because you are still contagious. But the whole world calls it a vaccin anyway 🤔 why ? To bypass health laws made to protect us. 

Second, it has not been tested on humans, at all. Vaccins take years to develop, this one is miraculously made within a year. You are the testgroup. 

Third, they said it would work but now its known it doesn't unless you take a booster shot, and you repeat that every 6 months. 

You are constantly being lied to by the government and the media, yet you do exactly what they told you to do. Even go to the length to say that those who don't trust this sketchy situation aren't good citizens. 

You my friend, are totally indoctrinated and exactly where they want you.

43,theblindness,"People ask this **every day**. It will work fine as long as you never need to transcode anything, but that's nearly impossible to control. There are a hundred reasons why Plex's media decision engine will trigger transcoding and some of them may baffle you. If you're planning on using all those different types of clients, transcoding isn't a risk; it's a guarantee. Plex absolutely **will** transcode sometimes, and when that happens, the Pi will not be able to handle it. Jellyfin can kind of transcode a little bit with the omx/mmal codecs, but even then performance is not great. By the way, the Pi4 is virtually unavailable right now. Raspberry Pi supply chain is all messed up right now due to a perfect storm of COVID, microchip shortage, global shipping crisis, and more. Good luck finding a Raspberry Pi for MSRP. You'd be lucky if a scalper only charged you an extra 30% markup, and I've seen listing on Amazon for much higher. Instead of paying $110 for a Raspberry Pi 4, plus another $30 on peripherals, you would be much better off buying a gently used thin client PC on eBay. If you're looking for the absolute cheapest ARM-based product to buy new, take a look at the Nvidia Shield Pro, which can do 4K transcosing *for free* without Plex Pass. Next step up would be anything with a Celeron or i3 processor, preferably based on Intel Goldmont Architecture or later, which gives you about 5+ years worth of products to choose from.

If you also want to run *arr apps, just keep in mind that each of them can gobble up multiple gigabytes of RAM, and that's nothing compared to the strain they'll put on your storage media during a full library scan. Radarr is the worst offender here. You can absolutely exhaust all the compute resources on a Pi  just from the *arr apps alone, let alone leaving anything left over for Plex.

Raspberry Pi is a great little board, and you should definitely get one, eventually, but if you're looking for a Plex server, you'd just be disappointed, so you should get an Intel-based NAS or a PC instead.",2021-10-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/q8k04k/does_anyone_run_pms_on_a_raspberry_pi_4/hgq482o/

1. There are people who just won’t stand the chance of surviving the virus without the help of the vaccine
2. For those who can survive, there are still pretty good chances of them getting it bad and needing hospitalisation. 

Those two reasons then bring the concern of healthcare system getting overwhelmed, which will have spillover effects on non-covid cases.

In SG it might not seem like a very serious illness because due to the small size of the country, government was actually able to reduce cases to virtually zero last year and gave a lot of people time to get vaccinated etc. So now with most people vaccinated, even if they get it most will not need hospital care. But without vaccine plus other measures, then u will see crazy scary stuff people in other countries have experienced.

You may say, why dont SG close borders longer and wait until vaccine effects can be observed longer. Then this becomes a question on which “poison” to take.
